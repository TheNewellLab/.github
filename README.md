It's the Newell Lab Github! Welcome to scenic views out the window.


Hello I don't know how to organize the repositories. Or 'repos' as the programmers would say. 

I think I will try organize it by type of analysis pipeline. Like one for TCRseq fastq files, one for clustering, one for cytof norming, one for 10x pipeline. 
We'll see.
